Welcome to WordGaze, first of all thank you for visiting my blog.

This blog is kind of an experiment, so you can expect to find lots of multiple subjects that I choose to adress,there's no boundaries except for my interests, but still I'll try to focus on some subjects more than others, specially with __software development__, which is my career.

__A few things about me__:
1. I'm a Software developer; currently I work primarly with .Net but I like to explore other technologies so don't worry, I wont spam this blog wih .Net and Microsoft stuff.
2. I'm also a student, so yes I haven't graduated yet, so I'm still learning a lot and I'd love to share what I learn.
3. I'm aware that it's very probable that no one will read this, but it doesn't matter, as much as this is an experiment it's also a great oportunity to practice writing and develop some experience with Gatsby and React.  

__A few things you can expect__:
1. Developers! Developers! Developers! Some software development related stuff.
2. Taveling, as most of the people, I love to travel inside and outside of Costa Rica, althought the second one is realy realy rare I have some plans for the future, so in the mean time there are lots of places here in Costa Rica that I'd like to share.
3. Climbing, from a beginner perspective... I'm starting so it'd be nice to track my progress writing about tips, technices, gear and more...
4. Lifestyle, and I know I'm pretty young but that doesn't stop my from writing about experiences and lessons that I've learned, if they worked for me (objectiveley, I like tangible results if possible) maybe they can work for you or at least give you another perspective.
5. Books, music and movies; I'm trying to read a lot more and also I love music and movies, having said that you can expect reviews about stuff I like.

So... I thing that's all for the intro, see you in the next post.
