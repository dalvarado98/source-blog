                WordGaze is created as a personal project for learning Gatsby and also for having some
                good time writing about multiple subjects that are part of my day to day. This blog is 
                targeted to development but I plan to write about much more; so expect some posts about 
                books, music, lifestyle, sport, traveling and whatever pops in my mind at some random 
                moment in space and time.

                Aside from the blog... I'm a 21 years old Software developer and Softwer Engineering 
                student, I'm at the starting point of my carrer so I figured out it would be nice to 
                write a little bit about this journey and at the same time learn something new.
